            <h2>About Pedro</h2>
            <p>
                Pedro Franceschin is a self taught web(3) full stack developer and smart contract engineer with particular expertise in EVM environments.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Although proficient in web development, he is particularly interested in leveraging blockchain technology to enable the institutional decentralization of our society.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The ecosystem of web applications that use the blockchain as a data layer is often called web3 (aside from it&apos;s more colloquial term, &quot;crypto&quot;).
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Pedro has about 3 years experience in developing open source web3 applications, including all facets of the work, from smart contract engineering, to web development,  blockchain integration and even some web design, having won prizes in hackathons and grants from big web3 players.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                He believes this technology will bring forth a positive movement in society, eroding the current centralization of markets, enabling new kinds of governance to emerge with a strictly voluntary character, as a democracy should be. In the end, people should have more sovereignty over their lives and institutions should exist to serve the people, not the other way around.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Pedro has an academic background in engineering (B.Sc) and Applied Economics (M.A).

                <br/>
                <br/>
